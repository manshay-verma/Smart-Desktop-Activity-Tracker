"Web Scraping + Image Recognition" Module
1. Tag Classification Based on Tool Type
Once you identify the image/tool (e.g., VS Code, Chrome, Photoshop), auto-assign a category like:

code_editor, web_browser, media_tool, email_client, office_app, social_media

➡️ Helps the ML engine later learn task patterns.

2. Confidence Score + Multiple Guesses
Show top 3 matches with confidence:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "guess_1": {"label": "Spotify", "confidence": 0.91},
  "guess_2": {"label": "Tidal", "confidence": 0.63},
  "guess_3": {"label": "SoundCloud", "confidence": 0.51}
}
Then scrape for each → pick highest match by comparing text/OCR info.

3. Auto-Tag User Intent
Based on keywords from the web scraping result, auto-annotate the intent:


Tool Detected	Intent Tag
VS Code	coding
Zoom	meeting
Gmail	emailing
Amazon	shopping
➡️ Great for timeline-based user activity summaries.

4. Icon Matching From Local DB (Offline Mode)
Store a DB of known tool icons + names.

First match locally

If not found, then do web scraping

Faster & works offline

5. Cropped Image Hashing to Avoid Re-checking
Use hashing (e.g., MD5 or perceptual hash) of cropped image to:

Check if already processed

Save bandwidth and time

6. User Feedback Option for Accuracy
In the UI:

“You were using: Spotify 🎧 — Is this correct?”
✅ Yes / ❌ No → Give correct name
➡️ Store for training your own classifier later

7. Tooltip or Hover Details in Sidebar
In the floating Qt slide:

Hovering on the tool name shows:

Description

Link to app website

“Open this app” or “Download” button (if it’s not installed)

8. Real-Time Suggestions for First-Time Apps
If your system sees a new app/tool for the first time:

“This looks like ‘Figma’ — click here to learn what it does.”

Great for helping users discover tools they use unconsciously.

9. Search Logs for Past Uses of That Tool
When a tool is detected, check your past JSON logs:

“You used ‘Figma’ 7 times this week for ~4 hours total.”

Connect this with productivity summaries!

10. Background Crawling for More Info
When user is idle or tool is minimized:

Scrape full website/blog/YouTube tutorials of the tool

Store as references for learning
