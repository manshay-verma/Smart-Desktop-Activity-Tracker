ML integration module can work, along with suggestions for each part — no code for now, just structure and how it works:

🔧 ML Integration Module - Purpose
Detect what kind of task the user is doing (e.g., coding, designing, browsing, debugging).

Suggest intelligent help: code documentation, bug solutions, tutorials, shortcuts, etc.

Trigger automation if a repeated task is detected (linked to your automation module).

🧠 How It Can Work (Architecture)
1. Task Detection Engine
Input: Logs (keyboard, mouse, screenshots, OCR text)

Use ML/NLP models to classify the current task:

Are you coding?

Browsing?

Debugging?

Watching tutorials?

➡️ Model type: Rule-based + fine-tuned BERT or lightweight transformer for activity classification.

2. Context Extractor
If you're writing code, extract:

Programming language (Python, C++)

Function names

Error messages

If bug or error is detected:

Parse the error type (e.g., IndexError: list out of range)

➡️ Use this as the query input for suggestion search.

3. Smart Suggestions Engine
Based on the task and context:

Show relevant Stack Overflow results

Show code snippets and official docs

Show fixes or similar solved errors

Use web scraping or APIs (optional GPT model integration later)

➡️ Example:

“You seem to be getting a ValueError in Python. Here are 3 common solutions.”

4. Bug Detection Module (for Coders)
OCR + keylog detects you are writing code.

Model parses the error from screen or console.

Shows fix suggestions, doc links, or syntax reminders.

➡️ Can be rule-based first, then fine-tune with your own training data.

5. Suggestion UI
Floating Qt panel shows:

What you’re doing

Suggestions in real-time

Error → solution panel

“Need Help?” button opens detail card

🔁 Automation Link
When the same task is done multiple times:

ML detects pattern

Suggests one-click automation

“You usually open VS Code and run this script. Automate this?”

🧠 Future Ideas
Integrate feedback: “Was this suggestion helpful?”

Learn over time → fine-tune your own suggestion model

Store task history to refine suggestions by user style
