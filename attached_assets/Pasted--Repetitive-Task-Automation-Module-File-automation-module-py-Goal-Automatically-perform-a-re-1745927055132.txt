 Repetitive Task Automation Module
📁 File: automation_module.py
🎯 Goal: Automatically perform a repeated task without user doing it again manually.

🔍 How It Works:
Learns the full sequence of actions (e.g., open app → type → click → save).

Records actions as a macro (mouse + keyboard + timing).

Executes that macro automatically when needed.

✅ Example:
"You always open VS Code, navigate to a folder, and run a script every morning. Let me do it for you in one click."

🔧 Tech Behind It:
Mouse + keyboard recorder

Macro playback engine

Trigger (based on time, screen content, or app open)

💡 2. Repetitive Task Suggestion Module
📁 File: repetitive_task_suggestion.py
🎯 Goal: Detect repeating behavior and suggest automation to the user.

🔍 How It Works:
Tracks logs (clicks, keys, apps used).

Analyzes patterns over time (e.g., "you open Chrome and go to a website every evening").

Offers UI popup: “Would you like to automate this?”

✅ Example:
“You've opened the folder Projects/Tracker/ 5 times this week. Want to open it automatically when your PC starts?”

🔧 Tech Behind It:
Log analyzer (timestamp, frequency)

Basic ML pattern detection or rule-based system

Suggestion UI that connects with automation module

🧠 3. Automation Module (Core)
📁 File: automation_core.py or macro_engine.py
🎯 Goal: Central engine to store, manage, and execute macros/tasks.

🔍 How It Works:
Handles the recording, saving, and executing of automation scripts.

Gets commands from either:

Suggestion module

User’s manual recording

Also validates that conditions are right before running automation (e.g., app is open)

✅ Example:
Suggestion module tells it: “User agreed to automate this”. Core module starts doing it automatically.

🔧 Tech Behind It:
Action runner

Task scheduler (optional)

Safety checks (app status, screen condition)
