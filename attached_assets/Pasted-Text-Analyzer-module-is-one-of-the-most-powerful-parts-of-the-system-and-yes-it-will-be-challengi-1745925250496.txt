Text Analyzer module is one of the most powerful parts of the system — and yes, it will be challenging, but very doable with a smart plan. Here's how I suggest you build it, step by step, with ideas to solve your problems:

🧠 Goal Recap:
You want the Text Analyzer module to:

Analyze text from screenshots.

Divide the screenshot into sections (like open windows or apps).

Highlight/label which section the mouse is in.

Show that area’s text or activity in a live sliding sidebar (floating UI).

✅ Suggested Architecture & Workflow:
📍 Step 1: Image Preprocessing
Convert the screenshot to grayscale (for faster OCR).

Use window detection:

Use edge detection (e.g., Canny filter).

Try to identify window borders, title bars, etc.

OR, use pre-trained object detection for known apps.

🔧 Optional: Add fixed logic for common layouts (left taskbar, top browser tabs, etc.).

📍 Step 2: Divide Screenshot into Sections
Once you detect window bounds, slice the screenshot into those window segments.

Assign a section ID like window_1, window_2, etc.

Save each cropped region separately.

Example: If Chrome and VS Code are open, crop both windows individually.

📍 Step 3: Mouse Position Mapping
At time of screenshot, you already have the (x, y) of mouse.

Check which window section contains that coordinate.

Mark it as the “active” area.

Save this in logs like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "screenshot": "path_to_image",
  "mouse_section": "window_2",
  "text_in_area": "You were browsing github.com",
  ...
}
📍 Step 4: OCR with Area Tagging
Use Tesseract OCR or easyocr to extract text from each cropped region.

Save results per window (or app) in a structured format like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "window_1": "Visual Studio Code - file.py",
  "window_2": "Google Chrome - StackOverflow",
  ...
}
📍 Step 5: Sidebar Floating UI (in Qt)
Create a floating Qt widget (always-on-top, semi-transparent).

Show:

Active App Name (based on mouse)

Text/Info from that window

Timestamp

Animate or auto-hide when idle

📍 Step 6: Challenges You’ll Face — and Ideas

Challenge	Suggestion
Hard to detect window boundaries	Start simple: Use fixed rules, then move to object detection or ML window classifiers
OCR might be slow	Crop only near the mouse first, or run OCR in a separate thread
Sidebar overlays important screen areas	Let user move it, or auto-position it based on active app
Too much data	Store logs in daily folders, summarize hourly
Window overlap	Detect Z-order if possible (Windows API), or just assume “topmost” based on click
🛠 Extras You Can Add Later
Detect app logos via image recognition (for branding)

Tag content (e.g., “Code window”, “Browser”, “Terminal”)

Add “confidence score” from OCR for each text block

Show frequent patterns (same tab, same app, repeated clicks)
